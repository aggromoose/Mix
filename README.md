# Mix

## Overview
Well the deal was that I was just sick of iTunes and I decided to make my own light-weight music player with the features that I wanted.  Currently its a work in development but I have big planes for it in the future. 

##Design

I really like material design so I decided to go mostly in that direction.  Also this is just my defualt color layout, all the colors will be customizable using the color.json included.

##Functionality

####Update-to-date music library
The thing I hated the most about the iTunes player was the fact that I had to import my music everything I downloaded something new that wasn't directly from the iTunes music library.  So I decided to make a player that would look in my Music folder making it so my library would always be up to date.

####Mixing
This is the part I'm currently working, I wanted to make a player that would seamlessly mix my music into one big track.  Of course this would be an options, so you could turn this off or on but I really like the idea of a endless dynamic playlist of music.
